# Advanced Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm System
## Project Overview

This is an enterprise-grade cryptocurrency trading system powered by neural networks, real-time data integration, and multi-agent decision-making architecture. The system integrates TradingView, Polygon.io, and Perplexity AI to create a comprehensive trading platform with advanced analytics and quantum-inspired optimization algorithms.

## Development Workflow: Opus Planning + Sonnet Execution

### Phase 1: Planning Mode (Use Claude Opus)
**Always start with planning mode for strategic decisions and architecture**

When approaching any feature or task:
1. Switch to Claude Opus model for planning
2. Enter plan mode explicitly
3. Use parallel subagent teams for decision-making:
   - **Architecture Team**: System design, scalability, integration patterns
   - **Finance Team**: Trading logic, risk models, market analysis
   - **Data Science Team**: ML models, feature engineering, backtesting
   - **Quantum Computing Team**: Optimization algorithms, quantum-inspired heuristics
   - **Security Team**: API security, key management, audit trails
   - **DevOps Team**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring

4. Document all decisions in `/docs/architecture/decisions/`
5. Create detailed implementation plans with task breakdown
6. Review and approve plan before execution

### Phase 2: Execution Mode (Use Claude Sonnet)
**Switch to Sonnet for token-efficient implementation**

After planning approval:
1. Switch to Claude Sonnet 4.5 model
2. Reference the approved plan document
3. Execute tasks in parallel using worktrees where applicable
4. Run tests and validation continuously
5. Document implementation details
6. Commit progress regularly with descriptive messages

## Worktree Architecture

### Purpose
Each major component runs in its own git worktree, enabling:
- Parallel development across features
- Isolated testing environments
- Independent terminal sessions
- Concurrent CI/CD pipelines
- Risk isolation (changes in one worktree don't affect others)

### Worktree Structure

```
RRRalgorithms/ (main)
├── worktrees/
│   ├── neural-network/      # ML models, training, inference
│   ├── data-pipeline/        # Data ingestion, processing, storage
│   ├── trading-engine/       # Order execution, position management
│   ├── risk-management/      # Portfolio risk, position sizing
│   ├── backtesting/          # Historical testing, optimization

│   ├── quantum-optimization/ # Quantum algorithms, optimization
│   └── monitoring/           # Observability, alerting, dashboards
```

### Worktree Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/setup/create-worktrees.sh`
2. **Development**: Open separate terminal for each worktree
3. **Coordination**: Use main repo for integration and releases
4. **Testing**: Each worktree has its own test suite
5. **Integration**: Merge completed features back to main

## Neural Network Algorithm Architecture

### Multi-Agent Decision System

The trading algorithm uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

```
Master Coordinator Agent
├── Market Analysis Agents (Parallel)
│   ├── Technical Analysis Agent
│   ├── Fundamental Analysis Agent
│   ├── Sentiment Analysis Agent
│   └── Pattern Recognition Agent
├── Strategy Selection Agents (Parallel)
│   ├── Trend Following Agent
│   ├── Mean Reversion Agent
│   ├── Arbitrage Agent
│   └── Market Making Agent
├── Risk Assessment Agents (Parallel)
│   ├── Portfolio Risk Agent
│   ├── Execution Risk Agent
│   └── Market Risk Agent
└── Execution Planning Agent
    ├── Order Routing Agent
    └── Position Management Agent
```

### Neural Network Components

1. **Price Prediction Network** (`src/neural-network/price_prediction/`)
   - Architecture: Transformer-based sequence model
   - Input: Multi-timeframe OHLCV, volume, order book
   - Output: Price movement probability distribution

2. **Sentiment Analysis Network** (`src/neural-network/sentiment/`)
   - Architecture: BERT-based NLP model
   - Input: News, social media, reports from Perplexity
   - Output: Sentiment scores and confidence levels

3. **Portfolio Optimization Network** (`src/neural-network/optimization/`)
   - Architecture: Quantum-inspired optimization (QAOA-inspired)
   - Input: Asset correlations, risk metrics, constraints
   - Output: Optimal portfolio weights

4. **Execution Strategy Network** (`src/neural-network/execution/`)
   - Architecture: Reinforcement Learning (PPO/SAC)
   - Input: Market microstructure, order book depth
   - Output: Optimal order placement strategy

### Parallel Subagent Decision Framework

For each major decision:

1. **Spawn Parallel Agents**: Use Claude's Task tool to create specialized agents
2. **Consensus Building**: Aggregate agent outputs using voting or weighted consensus
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Use meta-agent to resolve disagreements
4. **Decision Logging**: Record all agent inputs and final decision
5. **Backtesting**: Validate decisions against historical data

Example implementation:
```python
# Pseudo-code for parallel agent decision
decisions = await parallel_execute([
    technical_analysis_agent.analyze(market_data),
    sentiment_agent.analyze(news_data),
    risk_agent.assess(portfolio_state),
    quantum_optimizer.optimize(constraints)
])

final_decision = consensus_builder.aggregate(decisions)
```

## Development Guidelines
