3. Fill out the security advisory form with detailed information

### Alternative Method: Email

Send a detailed report to: **security@rrrventures.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### 1. Secrets Management

**Current Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - API keys exposed in plaintext

**Required Action**: All users must rotate API keys immediately

**Implementation**:
- All secrets are stored in macOS Keychain (not plaintext files)
- Environment-specific secrets isolation
- Automatic secret rotation every 90 days
- No secrets in source code or git history

**Setup Instructions**:
```bash
# Migrate secrets to Keychain
python scripts/security/migrate_secrets.py --remove-plaintext

# Rotate all exposed keys
# See: docs/security/API_KEY_ROTATION_GUIDE.md
```

### 2. Audit Logging

**Implementation**:
- All critical actions logged to Supabase database
- Immutable audit trail with Row Level Security
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Compliance reporting capabilities

**Logged Actions**:
- Order placements, cancellations, modifications
- Position opens, closes, modifications
- Risk limit breaches
- API key access and rotation
- Configuration changes
- Authentication events

### 3. Access Control

**Principles**:
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for production
- Separate credentials per environment

**API Key Permissions**:
- Read-only keys for data access
- Trade keys with minimum required permissions
- Never use admin/master keys in code
- Regular permission audits

### 4. Network Security

**Measures**:
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- Certificate pinning for critical APIs
- IP whitelisting for production systems
- VPN required for remote access

### 5. Data Protection

**Encryption**:
- Secrets encrypted at rest (Keychain)
- Database encryption (Supabase)
- TLS in transit
- Encrypted backups

**Data Retention**:
- Audit logs: 90 days minimum
- Error logs: Keep critical errors indefinitely
- Trading data: As required by regulations
- Personal data: GDPR/CCPA compliant

### 6. Code Security

**Practices**:
- Dependency scanning (Dependabot)
- Static code analysis (Bandit, Semgrep)
- No hardcoded secrets (pre-commit hooks)
- Security-focused code reviews
- Regular penetration testing

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Hooks check for:
# - Hardcoded secrets
# - Unsafe dependencies
# - Code quality issues
```

### 7. Incident Response

**Process**:
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerts
2. **Containment**: Immediate key rotation and access revocation
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis using audit logs
4. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities and deploy patches
5. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned
