## Next Steps
1. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
2. Update CI/CD pipelines
3. Remove backup after verification: `rm -rf /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/backups/worktree-backup-20251012-171022`

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore from backup:
```bash
# Restore git bundle
git bundle unbundle /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/backups/worktree-backup-20251012-171022/repo-backup.bundle

# Restore worktrees
cp -r /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/backups/worktree-backup-20251012-171022/* /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/worktrees/
```
