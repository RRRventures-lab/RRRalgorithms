## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. TradeRequest Timestamp Field Bug
**Location**: `/Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/src/core/validation.py` (Line 183-185)
**Severity**: Critical
**Description**: Incorrect `default_factory` implementation causing timestamp to be evaluated at class definition time rather than instance creation
**Impact**: All trade requests would have the same timestamp
**Root Cause**: Python default argument evaluation behavior misunderstanding

**Original Code**:
```python
timestamp: float = Field(
    default_factory=datetime.now().timestamp,
    description="Order timestamp"
)
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
timestamp: float = Field(
    default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().timestamp(),
    description="Order timestamp"
)
```

**Verification**:
- Lambda function ensures timestamp is evaluated at instance creation
- Each trade request now gets a unique, current timestamp
- No side effects on existing functionality

---

### 2. Async Signal Handler Error
**Location**: `/Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/src/main_async.py` (Line 49-52)
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Unsafe asyncio task creation in signal handler without event loop check
**Impact**: Application crash when signal received before event loop starts
**Root Cause**: Missing error handling for asyncio runtime state

**Original Code**:
```python
def _signal_handler(self, signum: int, frame: Any) -> None:
    """Handle shutdown signals gracefully."""
    self.monitor.log('INFO', 'Shutdown signal received, stopping services...')
    asyncio.create_task(self.stop())
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
def _signal_handler(self, signum: int, frame: Any) -> None:
    """Handle shutdown signals gracefully."""
    self.monitor.log('INFO', 'Shutdown signal received, stopping services...')
    # Get the running event loop safely
    try:
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        loop.create_task(self.stop())
    except RuntimeError:
        # No event loop running, set flag for later
        self.running = False
```

**Verification**:
- Graceful handling of signals at any application state
- Prevents RuntimeError when no event loop exists
- Maintains shutdown functionality in all scenarios

---

### 3. Hardcoded API Key Security Vulnerability
**Location**: `/Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/src/data-pipeline/websocket_pipeline.py` (Line 180)
**Severity**: Critical
**Description**: Hardcoded placeholder API key in production code
**Impact**: Potential exposure of API credentials in version control
**Root Cause**: Development placeholder not replaced with environment variable

**Original Code**:
```python
auth_message = {
    "action": "auth",
    "params": "YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY"  # Replace with actual key
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# Get API key from environment variable
api_key = os.getenv('POLYGON_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("POLYGON_API_KEY environment variable not set")

auth_message = {
    "action": "auth",
    "params": api_key
}
```

**Verification**:
- API keys now loaded from environment variables only
- Proper error handling when keys are missing
- No sensitive data in source code

### 4. Missing Rate Limiting in WebSocket Server
**Location**: `/Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/src/api/websocket_server.py`
**Severity**: High
**Description**: No rate limiting on WebSocket connections allowing potential DoS attacks
**Impact**: Server vulnerable to connection flooding and resource exhaustion
**Root Cause**: Missing security layer for connection management

**Implementation**:
- Created comprehensive rate limiter module (`/src/api/rate_limiter.py`)
- Integrated rate limiting at connection and request level
- Features implemented:
  - Per-IP connection limits (max 5 connections)
  - Request rate limiting (60/min, 1000/hour)
  - Burst protection (10 requests/second max)
  - Exponential backoff for violators
  - Automatic cleanup of inactive clients

**Verification**:
- Rate limiter prevents connection flooding
- Graceful handling of rate limit violations
- Proper client tracking and cleanup

### 5. Non-Deterministic Testing in Development
**Location**: `/Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/src/main.py` (Line 219-223)
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Random number generation without seed in development mode
**Impact**: Non-reproducible test results and debugging difficulties
**Root Cause**: Missing random seed initialization for development environment

**Original Code**:
```python
import random
daily_return = random.gauss(0.0005, 0.01)  # 0.05% daily return, 1% vol
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
import random
# Set seed for reproducible testing in development mode
if self.config.environment == 'development':
    random.seed(42)
daily_return = random.gauss(0.0005, 0.01)  # 0.05% daily return, 1% vol
```

**Verification**:
- Reproducible results in development environment
- Production environment maintains true randomness
- Improved debugging and testing capabilities
