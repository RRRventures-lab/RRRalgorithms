## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. API Key Status
⚠️ **Issue:** Legacy API keys were disabled at 22:43:34 UTC
- **Impact:** Cannot verify exact bar counts from database
- **Mitigation:** Used progress files and timing analysis
- **Resolution:** Re-enable legacy keys or use new publishable/secret keys

### 2. Data Validation
- **Status:** Unable to query Supabase for verification
- **Estimated Counts:** Based on 720 days × bars/day calculation
- **Actual Counts:** May vary slightly due to:
  - Market downtime
  - Exchange maintenance
  - Data gaps from Polygon.io

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Polygon Tier:** Currencies Starter (100 req/sec)
- **Actual Rate:** ~5 req/sec (conservative)
- **Impact:** None - completed successfully
