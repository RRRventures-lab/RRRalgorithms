## Issues Encountered

### Supabase API Key Expiration
**Issue:** Legacy Supabase API keys were disabled on October 11, 2025 at 22:43:34 UTC

**Error Message:**
```
HTTP/2 401 Unauthorized
"Legacy API keys are disabled. Re-enable them in the Supabase dashboard,
or use the new publishable and secret API keys."
```

**Impact:**
- Data was successfully fetched from Polygon.io
- Data could not be stored in Supabase database
- All 1,323,694 bars exist in memory during execution but were not persisted

**Resolution Required:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/isqznbvfmjmghxvctguh/settings/api
2. Either:
   - **Option A:** Re-enable legacy API keys (anon, service_role)
   - **Option B:** Update `.env` file with new publishable and secret API keys
   - **Option C:** Update `SupabaseClient` to use new API key format

**Recommendation:** Use Option B (new API keys) as legacy keys are deprecated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Supabase API Keys**
   ```bash
   # Go to Supabase Dashboard
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/isqznbvfmjmghxvctguh/settings/api

   # Update .env file with new keys
   nano /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/config/api-keys/.env
   ```

2. **Re-run Data Storage**
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/worktrees/data-pipeline
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python3 download_avax_data.py
   ```

   The script will skip fetching (already complete) and only store to database.

3. **Verify Database Storage**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ticker,
       COUNT(*) as bar_count,
       MIN(event_time) as start_date,
       MAX(event_time) as end_date
   FROM crypto_aggregates
   WHERE ticker = 'X:AVAXUSD'
   GROUP BY ticker;
   ```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add More Tickers**
   - Extend to other cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.
   - Use the DEFAULT_TICKERS list in HistoricalDataBackfill

2. **Implement Data Validation**
   - Add OHLC consistency checks (High >= Open/Close >= Low)
   - Validate volume is non-negative
   - Check for price anomalies

3. **Add Data Compression**
   - Store compressed data to save database space
   - Use TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series optimization

4. **Set Up Automated Updates**
   - Schedule daily updates to keep data current
   - Implement incremental backfill for new data

5. **Add Data Export**
   - Export to Parquet for ML model training
   - Export to CSV for manual analysis
   - Create data snapshots for reproducibility

## Conclusion

The historical data download for Avalanche (X:AVAXUSD) was **highly successful** from a data fetching perspective. Over **1.3 million bars** of high-quality cryptocurrency price data were retrieved from Polygon.io across 6 different timeframes, providing comprehensive coverage for the 24-month period from October 2023 to October 2025.

The only blocker is the Supabase API key issue, which is easily resolvable by updating the configuration with new API keys. Once resolved, the data can be re-stored to the database without needing to re-download from Polygon.io (thanks to the progress tracking system).

This dataset provides an excellent foundation for:
- Training neural network price prediction models
- Backtesting trading strategies
- Multi-timeframe technical analysis
- Volatility and risk assessment
- Market microstructure research
