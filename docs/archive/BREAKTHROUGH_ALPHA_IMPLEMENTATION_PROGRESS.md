# Breakthrough Alpha Discovery System - Implementation Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation Complete, Phase 2 In Progress
**Overall Progress**: ~25% Complete

---

## Executive Summary

We've pivoted from a conventional "download all data and backtest" approach to a **research-driven hypothesis testing framework** designed to discover inefficiencies no one else has found.

**Key Achievement**: Built the foundational infrastructure for testing 25+ market inefficiency hypotheses using alternative data sources (on-chain, order book microstructure, sentiment) and multi-agent ensemble decision-making.

**Next Steps**: Complete hypothesis documentation, begin testing top 3 hypotheses (whale tracking, order book imbalance, CEX-DEX arbitrage).

## 🔬 Key Research Questions

### Hypothesis 001 (Whale Tracking)
- [ ] What is the optimal threshold for "large" transfers? ($10M, $50M, $100M?)
- [ ] How long is the signal valid? (2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours?)
- [ ] Does signal strength vary by asset? (BTC vs ETH vs altcoins)
- [ ] Can we filter out false positives (custody transfers)?

### Hypothesis 002 (Order Book Imbalance)
- [ ] What is the optimal timeframe? (5-min, 15-min, 1-hour?)
- [ ] How much latency can we tolerate? (<1 sec for HFT, <30 sec for us?)
- [ ] Does signal work across all exchanges or specific to one?
- [ ] Are there spoofing patterns we can detect and filter?

### Hypothesis 003 (CEX-DEX Arbitrage)
- [ ] What is the minimum profitable spread after gas costs?
- [ ] How frequent are opportunities? (per day, per week?)
- [ ] Can we execute without flash loans (capital-intensive) or need them?
- [ ] What is MEV risk (front-running by miners)?
