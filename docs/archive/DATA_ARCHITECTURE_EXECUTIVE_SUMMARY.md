## TL;DR

The RRRalgorithms data architecture is well-designed for the current phase (Foundation, <10k msg/sec) but requires significant enhancements to reach production scale (100k+ msg/sec). The dual-schema approach (TimescaleDB + Supabase) creates complexity; consolidation is critical. Event sourcing, feature stores, and Lambda architecture are essential for 100x growth.

---

## Current State

### Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15) + Redis cache
- **Schema**: Dual schemas (TimescaleDB-aware + Supabase-native)
- **Scale**: ~1,000 data points/second
- **Tables**: 12 (8 with real-time subscriptions)
- **Data Retention**: 2 years (TimescaleDB schema only)

### Strengths
1. ✅ TimescaleDB schema with hypertables and compression
2. ✅ Real-time subscriptions for dashboard updates
3. ✅ Data quality validation framework
4. ✅ Redis caching (5s TTL for prices)
5. ✅ Comprehensive table coverage (market data, ML, trading, monitoring)

### Critical Gaps
1. ❌ Two competing schemas (maintenance nightmare)
2. ❌ No event sourcing (audit trail missing)
3. ❌ No feature store (ML training/serving skew risk)
4. ❌ Real-time-first design (unnecessary complexity for backtesting)
5. ❌ Missing time-series optimizations (continuous aggregates underutilized)
6. ❌ No data lineage tracking
7. ❌ Manual data quality checks (no automation)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Schema Architecture (Critical Issue)

**Problem**: Dual schemas create confusion
```
Schema 1 (TimescaleDB): BIGSERIAL IDs, hypertables, compression
Schema 2 (Supabase): UUID IDs, real-time, no compression
```

**Impact**:
- Developers confused about which to use
- Missing compression on 50% of data
- Inconsistent timestamp column names

**Recommendation**: **Consolidate to single TimescaleDB schema** (P0, 2 days)

### 2. Time-Series Performance (50x Speedup Available)

**Current**: Dashboard queries scan raw data (5s latency)

**Optimization**: Continuous aggregates cascade
```sql
Raw data → 5min rollup → 1h rollup → 1d rollup
(5s query) → (500ms) → (100ms) → (50ms)
```

**Recommendation**: **Implement continuous aggregates** (P0, 1 day)

### 3. Audit Trail Gap (Regulatory Risk)

**Current**: State-based architecture
- `orders` table stores current state only
- No history of amendments, partial fills
- Cannot replay to debug

**Recommendation**: **Implement event sourcing** (P1, 2 weeks)
```sql
order_events (append-only log)
  ↓
orders (current state projection)
```

**Compliance**: Required for MiFID II, SEC 17a-4

### 4. ML Pipeline (Training/Serving Skew)

**Current**: Features computed in-memory during training
```python
# Training
features = engineer_features(db.get_price_history(...))
model.train(features)

# Inference (different code path!)
features = engineer_features_online(latest_prices)  # SKEW RISK
model.predict(features)
```

**Recommendation**: **Deploy Feast feature store** (P1, 3 weeks)
- Consistent features for train/serve
- Point-in-time correctness (no data leakage)
- Feature reuse across models

### 5. Scalability Bottlenecks

**Target**: 100x growth (1k → 100k msg/sec)

| Component | Current Limit | Bottleneck | Solution |
|-----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Supabase writes | 5k TPS | Database | Migrate to TimescaleDB cluster |
| Real-time subs | 5k concurrent | Supabase | Use Kafka for pub/sub |
| Redis | 1GB single node | Memory | Redis Cluster (3 nodes) |
| Neural Network | 10 infer/sec | CPU | GPU inference server |

**Recommendation**: **Lambda architecture** (P2, 6 weeks)
```
Batch Layer: Kafka → Flink → TimescaleDB → S3 (immutable)
Speed Layer: Kafka → Redis Streams → Neural Network
Serving Layer: TimescaleDB (historical) + Redis (real-time)
```
