## üìã PHASE 1: Neural Networks (25 agents, 6-8 hours)

### Step 1: Open Claude Code Max

1. Open **Cursor IDE**
2. Start a **NEW Claude Code Max chat** (not Claude Sonnet)
3. Ensure you're using Claude Code Max (check model selector)

### Step 2: Navigate to Worktree

```bash
cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/worktrees/neural-network
```

### Step 3: Copy Activation Prompt

```bash
# Display the prompt
cat /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/docs/superthink-execution/phase-1-activation.md
```

**Copy everything** between the triple backticks:
- Start: `SUPERTHINK MODE ACTIVATED: Phase 1`
- End: `BEGIN EXECUTION NOW.`

### Step 4: Execute

1. Paste the entire prompt into Claude Code Max
2. Send the message
3. Claude Code Max will activate Superthink mode
4. Watch as 25 subagents work in parallel
5. This will take **6-8 hours**

### Step 5: Monitor Progress

While Phase 1 runs:

```bash
# Open tracker in another terminal
cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms
tail -f docs/superthink-execution/tracker.md

# Watch files being created
watch -n 30 'find worktrees/neural-network -name "*.py" -mmin -30'
```

### Step 6: Validate Completion

After Phase 1 completes:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms

# Run validation
./scripts/superthink/validate-phase.sh 1

# Check if models exist
ls -lh worktrees/neural-network/checkpoints/

# Verify quantum optimization
ls -lh worktrees/quantum-optimization/src/

# Check backtesting
ls -lh worktrees/backtesting/src/monte_carlo/
```

### Step 7: Update Tracker

```bash
# Edit tracker and mark Phase 1 tasks complete
vim docs/superthink-execution/tracker.md

# Change [ ] to [x] for completed subagents
```

### Step 8: Commit Progress

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Phase 1: Neural Network Training & Optimization

- 25 subagents executed successfully
- 3 models trained
- Quantum optimization complete
- 50,000+ Monte Carlo scenarios
- VaR/CVaR metrics implemented
- All 8 worktrees integrated"
```

---

## üìã PHASE 2A: Hypothesis Testing (10 agents, 4-6 hours)

### Step 1: Open Fresh Claude Code Max Chat

1. **Close the Phase 1 chat** (or start new one)
2. Start a **FRESH Claude Code Max chat**
3. Don't reuse the Phase 1 session

### Step 2: Navigate to Research Directory

```bash
cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/research
```

### Step 3: Copy Activation Prompt

```bash
# Display the prompt
cat /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms/docs/superthink-execution/phase-2a-activation.md
```

**Copy everything** between the triple backticks:
- Start: `SUPERTHINK MODE ACTIVATED: Phase 2A`
- End: `BEGIN EXECUTION NOW.`

### Step 4: Execute

1. Paste the entire prompt into Claude Code Max
2. Send the message
3. Claude Code Max will deploy 10 independent research agents
4. This will take **4-6 hours**

### Step 5: Monitor Progress

```bash
# Watch hypotheses being created
watch -n 30 'ls -lh research/hypotheses/*.md'

# Watch data being collected
watch -n 60 'ls -lh research/data/'

# Check testing framework
ls -lh research/testing/
```

### Step 6: Validate Completion

After Phase 2A completes:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Lexar/RRRVentures/RRRalgorithms

# Run validation
./scripts/superthink/validate-phase.sh 2a

# Check hypotheses
ls research/hypotheses/00*.md | wc -l  # Should be 13 total

# Check testing framework
ls research/testing/*.py

# Review results
cat research/hypotheses/priority_scores.json
```

### Step 7: Review Top 3 Strategies

```bash
# See which hypotheses were marked SCALE
grep -r "SCALE" research/hypotheses/

# Expected top 3:
# - CEX-DEX Arbitrage (Hypothesis 006)
# - Whale Tracking (Hypothesis 004)
# - Order Book Imbalance (Hypothesis 005)
```

### Step 8: Update Tracker & Commit

```bash
# Update tracker
vim docs/superthink-execution/tracker.md

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Phase 2A: Hypothesis Testing

- 10 hypotheses tested independently
- Top 3 identified for production
- Testing framework created
- Decision framework (KILL/ITERATE/SCALE) working
- Ready for Phase 2B implementation"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code Max not available"
‚Üí You need Claude Code Max subscription. This plan requires Superthink capabilities.

### "Phase taking longer than expected"
‚Üí Normal! Estimates are best-case. Complex work can take 10+ hours.

### "Some subagents failed"
‚Üí Review errors, fix issues, re-run specific subagent. Don't restart entire phase.

### "Tests failing after phase"
‚Üí That's what validation is for! Fix issues before proceeding to next phase.

### "Need to pause mid-phase"
‚Üí Finish at least one complete team before pausing. Update tracker with progress.

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps After Both Phases

Once Phase 1 and 2A are complete:

1. **Validate thoroughly** - Run all validation scripts
2. **Review results** - Check model metrics, hypothesis results
3. **Commit everything** - Save all progress to git
4. **Proceed to Phase 2B** - Implement top 3 strategies

**Phase 2B will take**: 4-6 hours with 12 agents (3 teams of 4)

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs in worktrees
2. Review activation prompts for task details
3. Run validation scripts to identify problems
4. Update tracker to mark what's actually complete
5. Don't hesitate to fix issues manually before continuing

---
