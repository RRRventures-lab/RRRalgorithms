# Team Structure & Organization

## Overview

The RRRalgorithms project is organized into specialized teams, each with distinct responsibilities and expertise. This structure enables parallel development using Claude Code's multi-agent architecture where specialized agents represent different team perspectives.

## Multi-Agent Team Architecture

When making decisions using Claude Code, we spawn parallel specialized agents representing each team:

## Decision-Making Process with Parallel Agents

### Example: Should we implement a new trading strategy?

**Step 1: Spawn Parallel Agents**

Use Claude Code to launch specialized agents:

```python
# Pseudo-code for agent orchestration
agents = [
    DevelopmentAgent(context="Implementation feasibility"),
    FinanceAgent(context="Strategy profitability and risk"),
    ProductAgent(context="Business value and priority"),
    DataScienceAgent(context="Data requirements and model capability"),
    ComputerScienceAgent(context="Performance and scalability"),
    QuantumAgent(context="Optimization potential")
]

results = await parallel_execute(agents)
```

**Step 2: Collect Team Inputs**

- **Development Team**: "Implementation will take 2 sprints, requires new market data API integration"
- **Finance Team**: "Backtests show 15% annual return with Sharpe ratio of 1.8, acceptable risk profile"
- **Product Management**: "High priority, aligns with Q2 roadmap, user demand confirmed"
- **Data Science Team**: "Requires additional features from order book data, model ready in 1 week"
- **Computer Science Team**: "Current infrastructure can handle 10x load, low latency achievable"
- **Quantum Computing Team**: "Portfolio optimization can be enhanced using QAOA for better capital allocation"

**Step 3: Consensus Building**

The Master Coordinator Agent aggregates:
- **Feasibility**: ✅ Technically feasible
- **Profitability**: ✅ Strong financial metrics
- **Priority**: ✅ High business value
- **Data Readiness**: ⚠️ Needs 1 week for additional data features
- **Performance**: ✅ Infrastructure ready
- **Optimization**: ✅ Quantum enhancement available

**Step 4: Final Decision**

**Decision**: **Approve with 1-week data preparation phase**

**Action Items**:
1. Data Science Team: Prepare order book features (1 week)
2. Development Team: Start API integration design (parallel work)
3. Finance Team: Refine backtest with new parameters
4. Quantum Team: Prototype portfolio optimization enhancement
5. Product Management: Update roadmap and communicate to stakeholders
