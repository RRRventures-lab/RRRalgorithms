- **Savings**: $1,000 - $1,700/month

### 2. Use Local Infrastructure (Save $325/month)

**Strategy**: Run on existing Mac Mini M4
- No cloud server costs
- No data transfer fees
- Use Tailscale for remote access
- **Savings**: $325/month

### 3. Negotiate Volume Discounts

**Strategy**: Contact AI providers for volume pricing
- OpenAI: 20-30% discount at scale
- Anthropic: Custom enterprise pricing
- **Savings**: $150 - $500/month

### 4. Optimize Trading Frequency

## Funding Options

### Option 1: Bootstrap (Recommended)
- Use existing RRRalgorithms infrastructure
- Start with $3,000 capital (3 agents)
- Scale gradually from profits
- No dilution, full control

### Option 2: Angel Investment
- Raise $100,000 for faster scaling
- Give up 10-15% equity
- Hire additional developers
