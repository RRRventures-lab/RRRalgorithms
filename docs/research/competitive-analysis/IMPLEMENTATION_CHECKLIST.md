## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **AI API Reliability**
   - Risk: API downtime or rate limits
   - Mitigation: Fallback to "hold", retry logic, multiple providers

2. **Exchange Connection**
   - Risk: Hyperliquid API issues
   - Mitigation: Connection health monitoring, automatic reconnection

3. **AI Decision Quality**
   - Risk: Invalid or dangerous trades
   - Mitigation: Strict validation, sanity checks, position limits

4. **Real-time Dashboard**
   - Risk: WebSocket disconnections
   - Mitigation: Auto-reconnect, optimistic UI, fallback to polling

5. **Capital Loss**
   - Risk: AI agents lose significant capital
   - Mitigation: Start small ($1k/agent), increase gradually, strict stop-loss
