## 📊 Claims vs Reality

### Performance Claims - MIXED ACCURACY

| Claim | Actual | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| "10x deque improvement" | **2.4x** | ⚠️ Overestimated 4x |
| "3-5x database improvement" | **41.2x** | ✅ Underestimated 8-14x! |
| "20x async throughput" | **Not measured** | ⚠️ Theoretical only |
| "6-10x latency improvement" | **Not measured** | ⚠️ Theoretical only |

**Reality:** Some claims overestimated, some underestimated. Database improvement is **exceptional** (41x!), deque is **real but modest** (2.4x).

### Score Claims - OPTIMISTIC

| Claim | Verified | Realistic | Verdict |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| "100/100 perfect score" | **87/100** | 87-93/100 | ⚠️ Aspirational |
| "A+ in all categories" | **B+ overall** | B+ to A- | ⚠️ Optimistic |
| "+28 points improvement" | **+15 points** | +15-21 pts | ⚠️ High-end estimate |

**Reality:** The 100/100 was aspirational. **Verified improvement is 87/100 (B+)**, which is still excellent progress from 72/100 (B-).

### Code Claims - MOSTLY ACCURATE

| Claim | Actual | Variance | Verdict |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| "3,500 lines" | **2,966 lines** | -15% | ⚠️ Slightly high |
| "56+ tests" | **60 tests** | +7% | ✅ Delivered more! |
| "150+ constants" | **~150 constants** | Accurate | ✅ Correct |
| "18 doc files" | **18 files** | Exact | ✅ Perfect |

**Reality:** Line counts slightly inflated but test count exceeded promises.
